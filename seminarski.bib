	abstract = {Abstract Clustering refers to the task of identifying groups or clusters in a data set. In density-based clustering, a cluster is a set of data objects spread in the data space over a contiguous region of high density of objects. Density-based clusters are separated from each other by contiguous regions of low density of objects. Data objects located in low-density regions are typically considered noise or outliers. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.
